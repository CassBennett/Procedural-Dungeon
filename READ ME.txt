(Github was not used as source control for this project, but is used to host the code)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Project Description:
This project is an application I developed for the Procedural Generation module at Abertay University in the Computer Games Technology Course.
The application recursively generates a 3D dungeon each time it is ran, with rooms at random sizes and adjustable dungeon depth. 
Project files I specifically worked on are found in '.../Procedural_App/SourceCode/Engine/DungeonSourceFiles' 
Files used from previous projects or given as foundation from a lecturer and adapted to the project are found in '.../ProceduralApp/SourceCode/Engine/FoundationSourceFiles' 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:

- Executable folder as well as Source folder
- 3D Procedural Dungeon Generation
- Instructions
- Player Movement
- Collision with generated walls (Can be toggled on/off)
- Distortion post processing shader (Can be toggled on/off as well as the intensity changed in real-time)
- Wireframe toggle

Installation:

- Select the 'Clone or Download' button on the applications GitHub page - https://github.com/CassBennett/Procedural-Dungeon
- Download the Project Zip
- Extract All and open the ProceduralApp folder 

To run the program:
	- In the 'ProceduralApp' folder, open the 'Build' folder
	- Double Click the 'Run Dungeon.exe' executable file. 
	* This will procedurally generate a dungeon with a depth of 5 (General size) * 

To access the source or Visual Studio Solution:
	- In the 'ProceduralApp' folder, open the 'SourceCode' folder
	
	* Source files * 
	- All source files of the project can be found in the 'Engine' folder within the 'SourceCode' folder. 
	- The 'DungeonSourceFiles' folder holds the source files that I worked significantly on, specifically for the dungeon project
	- The 'FoundationSourceFiles' folder holds the source files that I adapted to this project using previously used code, or code provided by the lecturers at Abertay University
	- The Shader files can be found in the 'Engine' folder.

	* Visual Studio Solution * 
	- To open the project in Visual Studio, open the 'Engine.sln' solution file that can be found in the 'SourceCode' folder.
	- You will need Visual Studio 12 or higher to compile the project as it is, otherwise you may need to change the Platform Toolset in the Solution Properties
